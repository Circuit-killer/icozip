# ICOZIP

ICO Zip is intended to be a demonstration repository, demonstrating how the
[ZipCPU](https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu) may be placed onto an
[ICO board](http://www.icoboard.org).

Particular goals of this project include:
- Generate the main project files using [AutoFPGA](https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga)
- Demonstrate the ZipCPU running [tttt](https://github.com/ZipCPU/tttt), a 4x4x4 tic-tac-toe game

A unique feature of this project is that the Raspberry Pi that will host the
ICO board will only have a minor role in the project.  My intention is to
use the Raspberry Pi only as a TCP/IP stack the provides access to 1) a command
port on the FPGA, 2) a serial port within the FPGA, and perhaps even 3) a means
of downloading new bit files to the FPGA.  If all goes well, then, one should
only need to run the [netpport](sw/host/netpport) on the Raspberry Pi, and after
that everything should be accessable through the TCP/IP port numbers given
in [port.h](sw/host/port.h).

This actually has a *very* profound consequence.  By allowing the user to have
access to the internals of the FPGA, peripheral development may be done and
verified prior to placing the CPU into the FPGA.  Hence, by the time the CPU
is placed on board, all the parts and pieces of the design will already be
known to work, leaving the only new variable that of the CPU itself.
